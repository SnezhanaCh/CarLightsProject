Create a SW module (LightControlModule) which to handle the whole Lighting related functionalities in a Car.
Create a ControlerECU simulator which to be able to test all the functionalities by keyboard commands.

The LightControlModule module will be used by:

 - TrunkECU
 - DoorECU
 - BrakeECU
 - GloveboxECU
 - HeadUnitECU
 - KeyHandlingECU (the ECU that communicates with the car owner's key)
 - SteeringWheel_StickECU (the stick located next to the steering wheel)
 - DiagnosticECU (that ECU is used to inform the system for any updates of the car state)

The LightControlModule shall provide the functionality to control all the car available lights to every ECU
The LightControlModule has to be flexible enough to be able to support new ECUs in the future

The Light modules that has to be controled are:
 - FogLights
 - DayLights
 - LowBeam
 - HighBeam
 - BackLights
 - Blinkers
 - StopLights
 - NumberPlateLights
 - CeilingLights (the lights in the car coupe)
 - TrunkLights
 - GloveboxLights
 - AmbientLights
 - DoorLights
 - FloorLights

Functional APIs:

TrunkECU
 - TrunkOpen
 - TrunkClosed
 
DoorECU
 - DoorOpened
 - DoorClosed

BrakeECU
 - BrakePressed
 - BrakeReleased

GloveboxECU
 - Glovebox_Opened
 - Glovebox_Closeed

KeyHandlingECU
 - Car_Unlocked
    -> Blink once all blinkers
    -> Start the LowBeam
 - Car_Locked
    -> Blink once all blinkers
    -> Stop all lights
 - OpenTrunk
    -> Start Trunk Lights 

SteeringWheel_StickECU
 - Daylights_OnOff
 - LowBeam_OnOff
 - HighBeam_OnOff
 - Blinkers_Left_OnOff
 - Blinkers_Left_5Blinks
 - Blinkers_Right_OnOff
 - Blinkers_Right_5Blinks

DiagnosticECU
 - LightsTest_On/Off
    -> On/Off all the lights
 - GetStatus
    -> Report all info for particular light
    -> Report all info for all lights
 - LightUpdate (to add/replace bulb. Set/updated bulb life expectency (0%-100%)
    -> For particular light
    -> For all lights

HeadUnitECU
 - WarningLights_OnOff
    -> Start/Stop all the blinkers
 - SetAmbientLightsColor
 - AdjustAmbientLightsBrightness
 - AmbientLights_OnOff
 - AdjustCoupeLightsBrightness (including the trunk lights)
 - CoupeLights_OnOff
    -> for particular Ceiling light or trunk light
